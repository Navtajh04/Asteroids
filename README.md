# Asteroids
Used C++ and the SFML library to create my own version of the classic arcade game Asteroids

The game is a space-themed shooter game where the player avoids being hit by asteroids or being shot by the alien that spawns every 15 seconds on higher levels. Once all of the asteroids and aliens have been cleared, the player advances to the next level, which increases the number of asteroids spawned.

Here is a video of me playing the game:

The left and right arrows are used to the turn the player ship, the up arrow is used to accelerate forwards, the down arrow is used to activate the breaks, spacebar is used to shoot, and R can be pressed to manually reload if you still have ammo, but the game will automatically reload at 0 ammo.
